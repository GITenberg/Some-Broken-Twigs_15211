<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD" />FOREWORD</h2>


<p>In the four seasons of the year there are many beautiful days as well
as dismal days in life. The broken twigs and trails, as well as the
good ones go to make up this world. All mark and show posterity the
way out of the woods.</p>

<p>These poems, and many other poems written by Mrs. Beede show these
things and the wonders of nature.</p>

<p>As only a true mother can, she has shown me these wonders. I sincerely
hope that all who read her poems will appreciate them as I do and reap
the benefit of the morals of her thoughtful and enjoyable poems and
know as I do her love of nature and things beautiful.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>For maid and lad New York is fairy land,<br /></span>
<span>Delightful charms in gorgeous brilliant lure!<br /></span>
<span>Our youth do struggle on ambition's tour.<br /></span>
<span>They meet life's challenge with true heart and hand.<br /></span>
<span>Forgotten trails are marked with scar and wand;<br /></span>
<span>A blasted rock and broken twigs assure<br /></span>
<span>The traveler that others fought the moor,<br /></span>
<span>And sailed the stormy breakers, crossed the sand<br /></span>
<span>To build the city on a granite slab.<br /></span>
<span>They tamed the wilderness, a sturdy clan!<br /></span>
<span>Retracing paths recall the glory made,<br /></span>
<span>Lays bare the secrets of the field and lab.<br /></span>
<span>Such tours give hope for future life and plan.<br /></span>
<span>Brave men have set the torch with ax and spade.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The coddled youth, like greenhouse plant<br /></span>
<span>Will wilt and die in desert sand,<br /></span>
<span>Can never meet the storms of life,<br /></span>
<span>Untried and mild and soft his hands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>He walks within the favored nooks,<br /></span>
<span>Protected there much more than those,<br /></span>
<span>Who meet the challenge face ahead,<br /></span>
<span>And struggle on to conquer foes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>They learn to take the gaff and thrust,<br /></span>
<span>And from an inner courage gain<br /></span>
<span>A faith in toil and love of truth;<br /></span>
<span>They pray to God to ease the pain.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="WINTER" id="WINTER" />WINTER</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>A glow of life shines from the leaf-stripped limbs,<br /></span>
<span>In sheltered nooks snowbirds are singing hymns.<br /></span>
<span>The sycamore shafts gleam and shine afar,<br /></span>
<span>Down by the river where the black oaks are.<br /></span>
<span>The goldenrod now droops his fuzzy head;<br /></span>
<span>There by my fence, leaves make a fluffy bed.<br /></span>
<span>They mulch my flower seed down in the loam;<br /></span>
<span>Beyond below the tall sedge grasses moan.<br /></span>
<span>Seared grass curls firmly over tender sprigs,<br /></span>
<span>And my rose bush there curves its brown thorned twigs.<br /></span>
<span>Beneath my window, tulip bulbs lay snug,<br /></span>
<span>Quite safe and warm in earthy winter rug.<br /></span>
<span>All nature resting for a springtime gain,<br /></span>
<span>And quiet gray tones soothe an inner pain.<br /></span>

<span>Cow-bells tinkling distant<br /></span>
<span>Farmer on the lea,<br /></span>
<span>Cattle nibbling grasses<br /></span>
<span>Little honey bee.<br /></span>
<span>Frosted leaves of autumn<br /></span>
<span>Sailing down the stream.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>O happy, happy heart, that can but leap<br /></span>
<span>For joy, when you return to me again;<br /></span>
<span>The love within grows fresh as morning glen,<br /></span>
<span>Awakes and lights the gloom where shadows creep.<br /></span>
<span>&mdash;The night will come and with it women weep.<br /></span>
<span>Stay, Dear, with me, for dark will come and then,<br /></span>
<span>It fills the soul with fear&mdash;don't go again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Black clouds will roll, when only children sleep.<br /></span>
<span>O Darling storms of midnight vex and threat;<br /></span>
<span>The gullies moan and then the goblins see!<br /></span>
<span>It is not wise or brave to prattle so;<br /></span>
<span>And Dear, if you must go, I will not fret;<br /></span>
<span>The sun will shine when you come home to me,<br /></span>
<span>Dark night is day and only mild winds blow.<br /></span>

<span>And withered is the corn and grasses and grain.<br /></span>
<span>The dust clings thick on every sill and pane.<br /></span>
<span>A shower soon refreshes loam and clay.<br /></span>
<span>The little stream resumes its cheerful hymn.<br /></span>

<span>But noon will burn the grasses by the way<br /></span>
<span>And give the girl there at the soda fount<br /></span>
<span>A welcome trade. The heat will parch the earth,<br /></span>
<span>So that flowers will wilt and droop their charm.<br /></span>
<span>But night will come and bring refreshing breeze<br /></span>
<span>And fold a soothing mantle over all<br /></span>
<span>Like mother spreading blankets over Tom.<br /></span>
<span>Now day by day the summer slips on by,<br /></span>
<span>Its stifling heat and gloomy skies will pass.<br /></span>
<span>And winter cold will come with hoary frost;<br /></span>
<span>Yet by our hearths we rest in quiet peace,<br /></span>
<span>Secure our roofs and snug our sheltered beds.<br /></span>
<span>Remember Spring, how roses bloom and flamed!<br /></span>
<span>And how the sunny days kept pace with time.<br /></span>
<span>In winter some hours will be gilded gold.<br /></span>
<span>It's true our blessings add up more than half.<br /></span>

<span>A multitude of lights twinkled in glee;<br /></span>
<span>Receding ones reached out, their friendship gleamed<br /></span>
<span>With hands across to shield from dark, it seemed;<br /></span>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
